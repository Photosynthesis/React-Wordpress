# A Plugin for Experimenting with React in Wordpress

Roughly based on instructions for embedding React in Wordpress [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-embed-a-react-application-in-wordpress-on-ubuntu-18-04).

Uses a shortcode to embed a React app in Wordpress posts or pages. The app can interact with WP using the WP JSON API. Once built, the app can be deployed as a normal plugin (without requiring the React build environment).

Some details on the build situation are in the auto-generated readme from Create-React-App [here](https://github.com/Photosynthesis/React-Wordpress/blob/master/widget/README.md).
